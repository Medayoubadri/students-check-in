### 🛠️ Technical Details

This app harnesses the power of Next.js 14's server-side rendering capabilities to deliver exceptional performance and SEO benefits. We've designed the user interface with TailwindCSS, creating a responsive and modern experience that adapts seamlessly across all devices. For consistent component design, we've integrated Shadcn UI, which not only enhances visual appeal but also simplifies maintenance and extensibility of the codebase.

User interactions are handled smoothly through React Hook Form, complemented by Zod for robust form validation. Behind the scenes, React Query manages data fetching and synchronization, ensuring efficient data handling and real-time updates throughout the application. Security is paramount, which is why we've implemented NextAuth for authentication, allowing users to securely access the system using their Google or GitHub credentials.

On the database front, we utilize Prisma ORM to streamline interactions with our PostgreSQL database hosted on NeonDB. This architecture supports robust data management while enabling real-time updates where needed. The dashboard experience provides teachers with immediate access to attendance statistics, allowing for effective monitoring of student presence.

We've structured the project following industry best practices, with clear separation between components, pages, and API routes. All code is thoroughly documented to facilitate understanding and collaboration among developers, making it straightforward for new team members to contribute effectively.
